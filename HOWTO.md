## Drink It Up - How To ‚ùì
The Drink It Up app was made to be as simple as possible. So simple that it's almost scary simple.
When you open the app or power on your computer, the app begins counting down from the length
you specify in the frequency box. Every 10, 15, 20, etc. minutes, the app sends you a reminder
to take a big swig of water. üíß

**The only rule:** when you get the notification, you get up. There's no point in us spending hours
coding an app that reminds you to drink water if you won't do it, and we're positive it'll make you
more healthy and productive.
