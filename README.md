## Hydrate or diedrate!! ðŸ¥¤

This app for Windows (other OS's coming soon!) sends a desktop reminder at the user's frequency to remind them to take a swig of water.
Water is _essential_ to happiness, stress-free life, survival, and productivity.
The body is 60% water and being dehydrated keeps you from feeling amazing.

### Who this is for ðŸ‘¦
Have you ever been coding, writing a long essay, or creating something on the computer and you just couldn't put it down?
This is quite common and in the midst of a mentally demanding task you can completely forget to drink water.
Even if you feel dehydrated, sometimes you put off drinking because you'll have to take away your focus.

The longer you battle thirstation and the need to be active, the worse your productivity gets.
Drink It Up allows you to forget about making water trips and automatically sends a reminder to your desktop.
