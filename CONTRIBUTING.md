Thanks for taking an interest! Drink It Up is a extremely simple app, but if you find
anything you think could be improved upon we would love to hear it! A great way
to do this is by creating an [issue](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Drink-It-Up/issues/new/choose).

You can also check out the [To-Do List](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Drink-It-Up/blob/master/TODO.md)
to see what needs to be completed next.

This program is written in C# on Visual Studio Community 2019 (Preview). If you know the
language, you can clone the solution and make the edits yourself. Create a pull request
and we'll take a look at your code. ðŸ‘€
